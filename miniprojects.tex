Integer Chains: An integer chain is defined as a sequence of integers $(x_i)_{i=1}^k$ such that for any two consecutive integers,
one is a factor of the other.
Given $N\in \mathbb{Z}$,
we are interested in finding the length of the longest integer chain in $S = \{k \in \mathbb{Z} | 1\le k \le N\}$.
Write code to answer this question for general $N$ and answer it for $N = 25$.
In addition, you can attempt to write your code to run quicker (mine takes 176 seconds using a parfor loop and 450 seconds using a regular for loop) and to use fewer lines (mine uses 29 lines of code).

Neural Networks: (Note: This is taken directly from the UCI Data Science Initiative (DSI) github: 
\href{https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/LearningWithPython}{https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/LearningWithPython})
Use Python's tensorflow and/or keras packages to build and train neural nets.
You can use them to discriminate Higgs bosons, classify pictures of animals, classify handwritten numbers, or anything else you desire.
